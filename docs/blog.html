                    <h3> Session 1</h3><br>
                    The project I am going to focus on is a web application that employes React.js as the library
                    for front end development phase. Also I am going to work with Express.js as the Back-End.
                    The resorces that I am going to work on are Linkedin Learning tutorials, Blogs, Medium and videos on YouTube.
                    Some of the blogs that will help me in this way are:<br />

                    </span>
                    At the first step of the project, I am going to make an abstract model of the project that I want to work on and
                    complete its parts during the other sessions. Since I am going to work with React.js, I have to define different
                    parts of each page as a component, which can be used in other pages. Based on this concept. I made the following routes and components:
                    <br>

            <h3>2nd Session</h3>

            At the second session I started learning React.js component system. I used Linkedin learning videos and official React website and gitub pages
            to get a clear understanding of how React works. The good thing is that the fundation is already prepared by the publisher and the main
            work is to create components and join them together to work in desired way. In this session I orginized the application based on the map I created
            in the last session:<br>

            <h3>3rd Session</h3>
            One of the main part of every web application is working with external RESTful APIs. I had no knowledge how to work with an API. So I spend
            the whole session exploring different APIs and how I can get something from an external api. I watched 2 courses on Linkedin learning and
            learned basics of REST APIs and how I can use APIs in React.

            <h3>4th Session</h3>
            After exploring and learning basics of REST APIs, I tried to use it in a simple way. I made a small React component that convert currencies to each other.
            For doing the calculation I use the API feature of https://www.currencyconverterapi.com/. To test the API, at the following form, you can enter
            an amount of money (for example 10), then the base currency in capital letters (like UDS), and the last the desired currency in capital letters (like IRR). By
            clicking the convert button, the form will ask the api with the values you provided and the api will provide the calculated amount for you.

            <h3>5th and 6th Sessions</h3>
            The new goal is to deploy what I created in the last sessions on one of the cloud platforms. The first choice was Heroku.com. So I started searching on the google for realizing how I can deploy a project on a cloud platform and the first question that I encountered
            was:<br>
            <strong>What is your applications stack?</strong><br>
            I have no idea what it exactly means. So I started searching about application stack and the definition was:<br>
            <strong>Application Stack</strong>: a bundle of software that runs everything from the frontend to the backend, from database to server administration to rendering the website. There are some common bundles. The most Famous being the LAMP stack in which <br>
            L = Linux (as the administrative software)<br>
            A = Apache (as the web server software)<br>
            M = MySQL (as the database) <br>
            P = PHP or Python (as the programming language)<br>
                          <br>
            After understanding the Stack concept. I was just curious what stack I have worked in so far and after a quick search on google I realized that it is called  MERN stack. It is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic websites and web applications.
            To understand more about MERN stack and similar stacks in this category<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(solution_stack)"> this Wikipedia page</a> helped me.
            <br>
            Now that I understood the Stack of my application. I followed the instruction in <a href="https://youtu.be/5PaUiPyBDJY">this Youtube video</a> to deploy my application on Heroku. However the work was not as smooth as I expected. Soon I ran into a problem and it was:<br>
            After using the <code>npm run build</code> command at terminal, I expected to see a folder with name "build" at my "client" directory. But it did not happen.<br>
            I searched for the problem on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> and found that the command <code>npm audit fix</code> might help to resolve the issue. The good news was that the build folder was now created in the Client directory but the bad news was that I was still
            unable to deploy the application on Heroku. I followed all the steps in the video but the deployment failed each time I tried. First time the error title was " Browser list: caniuse-lite is outdated". I looked for a solution on Stackoverflow.com and found the command <code>npm i browserlist</code> and
            <code>npm i coniuse-lite</code> and resolved this issue. But still deployment was not successfull. After searching in the google and Stackoverflow and reading the community questions. I found the issue. It was very interesting though:<br>
            in the "package.json" file on the server side I had added the following command at "scripts" part : <br /><code>"heroku-postbuild":"cd client && npm install && npm run build" </code> <br>
            But the problem was that as a habit of practice, I put a comma (,) at the end of the line (like what I do after the last element an array / object in JavaScript) and it was the cause of the problem. I removed it and YES! deployed on Heroku successfully.

            <h3>7th and 8th Sessions</h3>
            Though I deployed the application on Heroku and it is now available at <a href="https://totellapp.herokuapp.com/"> totellapp.herokuapp.com</a>, the application is not connected to the database and it makes it useless since there is no search functionality and you cannot Loging or sign up on it.
            After doing some research and asking some friends, I realized that it is the problem that many users have with Heroku and it takes some time to resolve the issue. However, based on an expert's suggestion I decided to try Amazon Web Serivices first and deploy the application on it to see if I have <thead>
              same problem there or not. Overally, I have to say that experiencing Heroku is far more diffrent that experiencing AWS. It takes too much effort to deploy something on AWS and the process is much more complex. However I decided to give it a try and see what will happen.<br>
              To start my AWS experience, I looked for resorces on the internet and found an interesting and step-by-step guide for MERN stack deployment at <a href="https://jasonwatmore.com/"> Jason Watmore's Blog</a>. I followed the steps on his
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FanoTGjkxhQ">Youtube video with title "React + Node.js on AWS - How to Deploy a MERN Stack App to Amazon EC2"</a>.<br>
            <strong>Step 1: Creating an AWS instance</strong><br>
            This step consisted of some tasks as follow:<br>
            1. Creating a new <i>Ubuntu</i> instance server on AWS <i>EC2</i><br>
            after loging to aws and login to <i>AWS Management Console</i>, from section <i>All Services</i> under the <i>Compute</i> cluster, select <i>EC2</i><br>
            2. Click on <i>Launch Instance</i> button <br>
            3. Choose AMI (Amazon Machine Image) and search for <i>Ubuntu</i> servers and select the first option <br>
            4. Select the instance Type (in this case "Free-tier") <br>
            5. from top menu, got to <i>6.Configure Security Groupe</i> and create a keypair in order to be able to connect to AWS through SSH and download it <br>
            6. Click on "Launch" <br>
            No the instance is created. By clicking on <i>View Instance</i> I can go to dashboard, where all instances will be visible with detail information.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Step 2: Connecting to Ubuntu EC2 instance via SSH</strong><br>
            This process was a little complex since I was working on a Windows platform and wanted to connect my Command prompt to a Linux terminal in order to push some commands on the server. The
            tutorial that I was following suggested using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html">AWS documentation for Connecting to Linux Instance from Windows Using PuTTY</a> to be able to do the connection possible.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Step 3: Connecting to Linux instance</strong><br>
            I followed the steps on the AWS documentation and connected the Windows Command Prompt to the Linux Terminal on the server and it was successfully connected <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Step 4: Transferring files to the Linux instance</strong><br>
            After the connection to the Linux instance command line the files can be transferred to the server with a single command. For example if you want to transfer a file with name "sample_file.txt" from the "C:\" rout on the windows to the "EC2-user" home directory on
            the Amazon Linux instance, the command line will be:<br>
            <code>pscp -i c:\path\my-key-pair.ppk c:\path\sample_file.txt ec2-user @ public_dns:/home/ec2-user/sample_file.txt</code><br>
            <br>
            <strong>Step 5: Deployment</strong><br>
            After creting an instance on AWS, for MERN stack, I have to setup web server with Node.js + MongoDB + NGINIX.<br>
            It can be implemented using ready codes provided by other community of practice members. I used the command provided by Jason Watmore that I mentione before.<br>

            <code>
              curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/cornflourblue/f0abd30f47d96d6ff127fe8a9e5bbd9f/raw/e3047c9dc3ce8b796e7354c92d2c47ce61981d2f/setup-nodejs-mongodb-production-server-on-ubuntu-1804.sh | sudo bash</code>
              <br>
          After setting up the web server, I  followed the steps to transfer my project from my Github repository to the server using the <code>sudo git clone https://gothub.com/projectRepositoryAddress</code><br>
          I followed all the steps in the instructions I found but I couldn't get any result from the AWS instance I made. Actually the first page that I got from Heroku, I could not get from AWS. So my guess is that there might be something wrong with
          any part of my Stack. So the next plan is to go and review the whole MERN stack that I used for this project.

            <h3>9th and 10th Sessions</h3>
            <h4>Node.js</h4>
            I started Learning the MERN stack from the Node.js part. I found an interesting course on <a href="https://www.edx.org">edx.org</a> with title "Introduction to Node.js". It started with basics of installing and setting a Node.js environment. The main takeaways of this course for me were as follows:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Node is an interpreted language not a compiled one: that it is not as fast as comiled languages like C#, C++, etc. but it provides the opportunity to make changes in the code and see the results instantly</li>
              <li>There are three main ways to launch a Node code: REPL, Eval Option, and Launching code from a file</li>
              <li>Node.js and browser JavaScript differ when it comes to globals. Developers should be familiar with these keywords: Process, Global, module.exports and exports</li>

            </ul>
            During this course I learned about the following topics:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Node.js Globals</li>
              <li>Node.js Process</li>
              <li>Command-line Arguments</li>
              <li>"require" and "Module.exports"</li>
              <li>Core Modules like "fs", "path", "http"</li>
              <li>Event emmiters</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Learning Node.js requires getting familiar with "npm" (Node package Manager) as well. Npm consists of three components:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Website: www.npmjs.com</li>
              <li>command-line tool: npm</li>
              <li>Registries: public and private</li>
            </ul><br>
            We need either the <code>package.json</code> file or "node_modules" folder to install modules locally. The best thing about npm is that it keeps all the dependencies local.<br>
            To install a  module locally we use either <code>npm install module-name</code> or <code>npm i module-name</code><br>
            To install a module globally, we use either <code>npm install --global module-name</code> or <code>npm i -g module-name</code><br>
            To remove an npm module locally, use <code>npm rm module-name</code><br>
            To remove a global moduel, use <code>npm rm module-name -g</code><br>
            <br>
            <h4>Express.js</h4>
            Express.js is a web framework based on the core Node.js "http" module and connect components. The components are called "middleware" and they are the cornerstones of the framework philosophy "configuration over convention". i.e. Express systems are highly configurable, which allows developers to freely pick whatever
            libraries they need for a particular project. Some of the benefits of express include:
            <ul>
              <li>Deliver static content</li>
              <li>Modularize business logic</li>
              <li>construct an API</li>
              <li>Connect to various data source (with additional plugins)</li>
              <li>Write less code (vs. http)</li>
              <li>Validate data (with additional plugins)</li>
            </ul>
            The main Express app file is typically named app.js, server.js or index.js. It has the following sections:
            <ol>
              <li>Imports</li>
              <li>Instantiations</li>
              <li>Configurations</li>
              <li>Middleware</li>
              <li>Routes</li>
              <li>Error handlers</li>
              <li>Server Bootup or server export</li>
            </ol>
            I covered some topic related to each section and started learning MongoDB.<br>
            <br>
            <h4>MongoDB</h4>
            MongoDB is a NoSQL database. A good reason to use NoSQL databases is that, because they are schema-less, they are perfect for prototyping and for agile iterations. It is also a document store NoSQL databese (as opposed to key-value and wide-column NoSQL databases). It is the most mature and dependable NoSQL
            database available thus far. <br>
            MongoDB uses JavaScript. So all JavaScript and Node commands, classes and methods are a fair game in the Mongo console. In this section of learning, I learned the following skills:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>connecting to MongoDB</li>
              <li>Updating documents</li>
              <li>Removing Documents</li>
              <li>Finding Documents</li>
              <li>Coding CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST API with Node, Express and MongoDB</li>
              <li>Mongoose library: a fully developed object-document mapping (ODM) library for Node.js and MongoDB</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h5>Key Takeaway</h5>
            After covering these topics, I realized that there are a lot of mistakes at how I organized my files and modules in my projects. I was tempted to go and restructure the whole project that I have made in the previous sessions and align it with the best practices that I have learned in these modules.
            Learning new things is great, but I think reviewing what you already learned before helps to both stabilize your knowledge and skills and help you understand where you have mistakes and misunderstandings.
