                  Virtual reality or VR as a technology provides multiple affordances over any other accessible medium
                  in the history of human civilization. Human beings exist and interact with the world in three dimensions,
                   and our faculties and capabilities have evolved to suit this. Among the numerous applications that VR
                   can be used for, education stands out as being one of the most natural and effective.
                   We experimented with using VR to enable learning for students and other people, and chose history as a
                   subject. History in academic and educational environments is taught mostly as information presented
                   as a sequence of facts from an objective point. We think that it could be more effective as a
                   first-person experience of the times, events and narratives along with an exploration of VR
                   itself as a technology and its capability to affect and change people’s lives for the better.
                   Towards this end, we came up with this Project.

                  <br/>
                  For this project, we used <strong>Unity Game Engine</strong> software running on a computer and an Oculus Rift HMD. Using Unity, we created
                  a virtual environment of a restaurant. For the experience, the user would be wearing an HMD, and using hand-held tracking
                  devices. The tracking would mostly be of head motion and orientation (inertial), and optical for
                  the hand-held devices. The user would put the headset on and the first thing they see is the interior of a modern restaurant
                  as it exists in the present day. After the scene transitions, the second scene will be the same restaurant set in the past
                  (in this case, the 1920s).
                	Considering the time limit and a realistic scale for the project, we decided to work on spaces like cafes and restaurants
                  that might have a long history behind them and where many people might have common memories. It could satisfy our purpose
                  for letting the user feel social presence as well as self and physical presence.<br/>
                  The first part of the project involves the player putting on the Oculus headset. Once inside the virtual
                  environment, the player will be in a first-person environment of a restaurant. This restaurant will be modern
                  and familiar. Due to the movement limitations of using Oculus Rift, At the beginning of the experience, the player will
                  be situated at the far left-hand corner of
                  the room (near the restroom)and only can choose to look around 360 degrees. They can see a wide array of
                  tables, chairs and booths throughout the restaurant, with place settings at each table. The player can see an
                  empty parking lot outside of the windows. These are some of the clues we planted to make the user feel more like
                  being in a social context with people that happen to be doing anything unpredictable, just like a real life
                  scenario. Through the headphones in the Oculus headset, the player can hear ambient noises of multiple people
                  talking in a crowded restaurant.

                  As the player is standing next to the restroom in the back corner, the player will be instructed to turn towards the
                  payphone near the restroom (in the back corner). As the player looks at the payphone, it will begin ringing
                  (with a sound effect). The player will take a step towards the payphone. Once the player passes the trigger point,
                  which is right in front of the payphone, they will find themselves in a dark empty room with only the payphone visible.
                  The dark room will concentrate the user’s attention on the phone as the only visible element that is going to be their
                  time travel trigger. The light will be pointing down on the payphone but otherwise the room is completely dark.
                  Through the headphones, the player will hear a famous quote from True Detective: “Time is a flat circle. Everything
                  we have done or will do over and over and over again - forever.” (Gabriel Bailey from the IT lab provided the voice
                  for this quote). <br/>
                  After the phone rings twice, the environment will suddenly turn black, with the sound effects of electrical surges and
                  some digital binary numbers appear in green color on a black background (similar to what is seen in The Matrix).
                  After a few seconds, an oval-shaped white portal will open beside the payphone. We will instruct the player to
                  turn to their left-hand side so they may see the portal. The camera will move towards the portal automatically.
                  As the camera goes through the portal, some ominous music begins to play through the Oculus speakers
                  (specifically some musical score from the film Inception). The player will then be transported down a long white hallway.
                  On either side of the hallway, the background is white with binary code along the floor.

              As the player moves through this “hallway,” (automatically, the player will not need to physically move), the same restaurant
              exterior can be seen in the distance, moving towards the player. There are some marked changes, however. While the model of
              the restaurant is the same as what was seen in the first environment, there is no parking lot. Instead of clear windows along
              the walls, they are wooden and stained glass in a wide array of colors. (Fun fact: the windows are actually cabinet doors that
              double as windows for an older environment, which we used because we couldn’t find any better alternative on the Unity
              Asset Store). The doors are also stable doors instead of modern ones. Finally, there is an Old West-style sign on the roof
              of the restaurant.<br/>
              Once the camera arrives at the restaurant, it will travel through the front wall of the exterior and the “windows.” The player
              will come to rest inside the new restaurant. It is at this point that the player understands they have entered a different time period.
              The interior of the restaurant has changed to reflect the 1920s. The furniture is wooden instead of plastic. The lighting is older and
              in warmer, yellower tones (similar to candlelight). All of the modern appliances and signs have been removed from the environment.
              The stained glass “windows” also give the environment an old-time feel. Like the modern setting, there are a wide array of virtual
              human characters spread throughout the environment. Some are sitting at tables, while others mingle at the bar and talk to the bartender.
              Through the headphones, Edith Piaf’s “Non, je ne regrette rien” is playing. We wanted to create a jazzy 1920s environment for this scene
              in our project. The player is free to explore this environment as they see fit.

                  For this project, we used some ready assets from Unity Asset Store, including the modern restaurant space, the old furniture and
                  characters. The codes for this projects were hard coded in C# by us based on the triggers and functions we needed. All the codes are accessible
                  at my <a href="https://github.com/samandalib/UnityCode">Github Repository</a>. However, some of the codes that we used were already time-based,
                  i.e. when the user entered the trigger the code started and as the time passes, the other events happen automatically.<br/>

                  The <code>IEnumerator</code> function enables us to set some events happen based on a specific timing. For example, in the case of
                  activating transformation planes, a set of sounds, animations, and visual events must happen in an arranged schedule:<br/>

                  <br/>
                  One way we will measure the users’ experience is by doing a questionnaire before and after the virtual experience. Before
                  the user experiences the virtual environment, they will fill out a brief questionnaire that asks them how much they know
                  about a subject in history (depending on which area of history is being studied and experienced at that moment). The user
                  will then play our virtual experience. After they have completed the experience, a second questionnaire will be presented
                  them. In it, we will ask the user how they feel about history after having experienced a virtual history environment. We
                  would also ask the users if they are more interested to learn more about it or at least understand it better now that they
                   have “witnessed” history in action.<br/>
                   Another method of measuring can be objective. We can see how users behave when the time travel starts and the user is
                   experiencing another time period. Their excitement, emotions, and interactions with elements in the space can be subject of
                   notice that helps us understand how immersive the experience has been and how much the user feels present there. However,
                   the effectiveness of this method of measurement depends heavily on the experience and attention of the observer and the fact
                   that people might have different reactions to the same object can open the space for ambiguous behavioral interpretations.<br/>
                   The following video shows the behavior of a user while experiencing our time travel application:<br/>

                  <br/>
                  The main reason we wanted to create this virtual environment was for educational purposes. When designing our virtual
                  experience, we thought about how we wanted to make history subjects more interesting for elementary, middle school and
                  high school students. When students read about history in textbooks, the material can be very dry because there is a
                  disconnect between the student and the material. With this time travel virtual experience, the student will be able to
                   experience history in a visual medium rather than reading about it in a textbook. Our hope is that students will have a
                    deeper understanding by “witnessing” history in front of them. Once they understand the context of certain events
                    (for example, the 1920s), the students might be more interested to read about it. They will have an appropriate amount
                    of context for their history lessons if they are able to see it in a visual medium.<br/>
                  	When people try our virtual environment, we hope they will be impressed with how immersive the experience is. The first
                    thing we wanted to do with this environment was teach about history. For this final demo, we hope players will
                    have a deeper appreciation for the history of old buildings and what they witness. We were limited in the different
                    human characters we could place in our environment, so we tried to have fun with it. If the player has fun experiencing our virtual environment,
                    they may be more tempted to learn about history, which was what we were hoping to provide in this experience in the
                    first place.<br/>
                  	One of the things we learned while creating this project was how to manage users’ experience with a virtual environment.
                    As we were running tests, we were instructed to let the users know what to expect. For some of us, who had never
                    experienced a virtual environment before, this was unexpected. For example, we had to be reminded to let
                    the user know that the headphones should be properly placed so they can hear the music and dialogue. Overall, we learned
                    how to create a full, immersive environment that was incredibly realistic for the time we had to work on it.
                  	Finally, if we had had more time to work on this project, we would have created more decades to explore instead of just
                    the one. Originally, we wanted to have the user go to the bar and choose from a selection of drinks with different years
                    on the labels (a la Alice in Wonderland). Selecting the drink would then trigger the scene transition and it would change
                    to the corresponding decade. If we had more time, it would have been nice to have other decades like the 1950s or even a
                    different century like the 1800s or 1700s.<br/>

                  This project was part of a team work for the course "Virtual Environments" at the Information School
                  at UT Austin. It was supervised by <strong>Dr. Jakki Bailey</strong> and I had the chance to collaborate with <strong>Sashank Sai Marcharla</strong>
                  and <strong>Kaitlyn Salazar</strong> as my wonderful teammates.
