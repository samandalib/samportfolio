                  <br/>
                  Working with new tools and devices might need some training for many people. There are numerous ways to reach to the
                  instructions, for example reading a paper manual or book, watching a video, asking experts and etc. Within the recent
                  years<strong>Augmented Reality (AR)</strong>  has been developed as a way of adding information to the real world vision. One of the use
                  cases of AR can be its application for educating people in using such tools and devices. The advantage of AR over books
                  or other offline data sources is that <strong>the information can be presented at the same location as the object it relates to.</strong>
                  This provides a context for the information, often<strong> making it more engaging and easier to understand.</strong> The ability to
                  contextualize and localize virtual information is one of the greatest strengths of augmented reality, which is mostly
                  achieved by creating annotations in the space. Annotations make up a large portion of all AR content.
                  One of the use case AR is at educating people for using new devices and tools. In this research, we aim at presenting a
                  Hololens application which will aid and direct individuals in the use of technical tools and devices using Augmented Reality and compare
                  its usability in users' experience with common tools such as paper documentations and guidbooks.

                  <br/>
                  In our experiment, we propose to develop an instructional augmented reality application that will teach users in the operation
                  of the HP Designjet T7100Plotter Printer (HP Designjet T7100) at the University of Texas at Austin iSchool IT Lab. The reason
                  for selecting this tool is that it is rarely used by students at the iSchool, only by IT Lab staff. While the device is fairly simple to
                  use, it is very expensive and requires regular maintenance and care which can often be intimidating to new operators. By building up an
                  augmented reality instruction for this device, we’re going to observe how will students feel comfortable using the device by following
                  those instructions and will evaluate the extent to which AR helped them learn and use the device.
                  The results of this research can be considered for other devices with similar barriers to entry.<br/>

              Participants will be guided through a series of tasks involving the use of the HP Designjet T7100 including these tasks:<br/>


                <span> &#9745; Power on the printer </span><br/>
                <span>&#9745; Check available paper rolls </span><br/>
                <span>&#9745; Load appropriate paper rolls </span><br/>
                <span>&#9745; Print a poster </span><br/>

                In addition, the participants will be separated into two groups; one which uses the AR application, and another which uses written documentation
                provided by the manufac- turer. After participants have completed the tasks using their respective documentation as designated by their assigned group,
                they will be evaluated on their success and provided a SUS questionnaire to gauge their perceptions of the usability of the documentation used.

                  For doing this research, we divided the work into two sections:
                  At the first section, we prepared a paper guidebook for using the HP plotter. This guidebook was prepared based on the official documentation
                  available on the HP website. Each page of the guidebook consisted of one or two steps for doing the job. Then we asked 4 people, who have never
                  had experience of working with this machine, to use our guidebook for working with the machine to print a poster without using the help of any
                  other person.

                      At the second section, we used the same content in the guidebook to create a simple Hololens
                      application. In this app, we only had one step per page. We used <strong>Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) SDK </strong>to create a simple slideshow application
                      that consisted of a panel for showing the slides and <strong>three basic functions: Next, Back, and Reset.</strong> The interface was designed in <strong>
                      Unity Game Engine 2018.4.9f1</strong> version and the functions worked based on C# scripts either provided with the MRTK examples or written and/or edited scripts
                      by us in C#. The main part of the code in Unity is as below:

                          Users were asked to wear the Hololens for 15 minutes before starting the test in order to teach them the interactions that they could have with the device, e.g.
                          Air tap, Bloom, Voice Command, and Gaze. After the introductory part, we asked the participant to start working with the machine by following the guidelines on
                          the app. The same questionnaires were used to evaluate.

                  Users, who have had no experience of working with the machine before, have been asked to fill a pre-task questionnaire, consisting of four questions
                  about their perception of the task and the level of their confidence to do the task. This questionnaire used Likert scale as the optional answers that
                  the participant could choose from. During the test, one researcher takes care of the time of the process, one took notes of the incidents and probable
                  inconveniences that the user might be faced with, and another one took pictures of the whole process for further documentation. Also for the Hololens
                  application, the whole session was video recorded from user’s perspective using the recording capability of the Hololens. Also, the Hololens had the
                  Live Stream capability that allowed the researcher to see what the user is seeing at the moment and take notes about the behaviors that might correlate
                  with the content the user is dealing with. After doing the test, a post-task questionnaire with five questions similar to the pre-task questionnaire
                  and a <strong>System Usability Scale (SUS)</strong> questionnaire was used to measure the subjective usability of the application and the whole testing session experience.
                  Testing users with the paper document was iterated one time after the first time testing and some certain problems were identified that could be fixed for
                  the second round of testing. The same procedure happened for the Hololens as well.The data gathered through questionnaires were used to diagnose the main
                  issues that users faced with during the application of each guiding method. The results of questionnaires were used to do qualitative analysis and
                  comparing them with observatory understandings to refine the issues that can decrease the quality of experience for users.
                  Keeping the record of times of doing the task was a quantitative measurement for comparing the difference of usability between using each method.

                  <br/>
                  Users’ experience at all iterations of the paper documentation and Hololens Application was investigated using both objective and subjective methods. The main issues that resulted
                  in making modifications to the system (ie. paper guide or Hololens App) are discussed in this section. <br/>
                  <br/>

                  <strong>Paper Guidebook</strong> <br/>
                  Users’ lack of confidence to be able to complete the task without guidance or training was the common issue in the pre-task questionnaire.
                  The average time for completing the task using paper documentation was 12-15 minutes. Post task questionnaire results show that even after doing the print job,
                  users still do not feel confident doing this job alone. In fact, after the test with using the paper the average score of the post-task questionnaires depicted decrease
                  in amount which shows the system does not provide users with a good experience. The results from the SUS indicated that the most considerable problems with the paper
                  guidance were existence of too much inconsistency in this system. Also the average score for the whole system is 47.5 which is far from the industry average of 68.5.
                  The observation points that can be mentioned are:<br/>
                  <br/>
                  <strong>
                  <span> &#9888;  Keeping papers in hand makes the user inconvenient during the job </span><br/>
                  <span> &#9888;  Putting down the documents is a problem when the user wants to do the job while looking at the guides to get sure of doing the right task </span><br/>
                  <span> &#9888;  Some pictures and explanation text are on separate papers, making it easy to be missed, hard to understand and causing incoherent experience </span><br/>
                  <span> &#9888;  Large number of pages makes the user doubtful about covering all the steps </span><br/>
                  </strong>
                  <br/>

                  <strong>Hololens App</strong> <br/>

                  The results of the pre-task questionnaire show the same problem that users indicate in the paper version - they did not feel comfortable
                  doing the task without guidance or training. Users were trained on how to use Hololens and they were given some time to practice gestures
                  and voice commands to feel more comfortable with the device. During the test, the following issues were observed: <br/>
                  <br/>
                  <strong>
                  <span> &#9888;  Some users preferred the use of voice command rather than using gestures </span><br/>
                  <span> &#9888;  Gestures should be at a certain area and sometimes cannot be detected or recognized </span><br/>
                  <span> &#9888;  The voice command only worked when the user gazed at the Next or Back button and said “Select”. This caused when users gazing the button, they could not see the whole screen guidance </span><br/>
                  <span> &#9888;  Since there is a delay sometimes, users were confused if they succeed or not. As a result, they spoke the command again and the system just jumped some steps </span><br/>
                  <span> &#9888;  It was uncomfortable for users to gaze (cannot move their heads) and use gestures or voice commands each time to go to the next step </span><br/>
                  <span> &#9888;  Users who wear glasses experience difficulty using Hololens applications </span><br/>
                  <span> &#9888;  Some users found the size of interaction buttons small and preferred larger sizes for better interaction  </span><br/>
                  <br/>
                  </strong>

                  The time of completion of the task for users was around 6-8 minutes.
                  After the test, users were asked to fill post-task questionnaires and SUS. The results from the Post-task questionnaire showed a greater
                  amount of confidence in their ability to complete the task without guidance or training compared with the paper documentation.
                  The results from SUS indicated that the issue of inconsistency is the main problem that users find in the content of the app.
                  Also, lots of users showed a need for the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.

                    <strong style="font-size:2em;">Final Iteration</strong><br/>
                    The iteration of testing the Hololens App was conducted after making some alterations to the app. Since it was clear that many users
                     preferred using voice command rather than Airtap gestures, we put more focus on utilizing the app with this function. <br/>
                     <span> &#9888;</span>The first version only allowed saying “Select” as a command while gazing at a specific button;
                     <span> &#9755;</span>however, the second version allowed users to
                     say “Next Slide” or “Previous Slide” without gazing. Therefore,<span> &#9888;</span> despite the first version in which the “Next” and “Back” buttons
                     were occupying a considerable amount of possible field of view, <span> &#9755;</span>in the second version, they were reduced to small buttons at the
                     bottom of the slideshow panel and voice <span> &#9755;</span>command was valued more. <br/>
                     <span> &#9889;</span>Observing users during the test indicated that, when afforded the
                     ability to use voice commands without requiring gaze, users navigated almost entirely by voice command. Participants experienced
                     relative ease completing the task and were both successful in task completion, <span> &#9888;</span>finishing the process in roughly six to seven minutes.
                     <span> &#9888;</span> participants in the second version also exhibited the highest increase in confidence metrics as defined by the difference between the sum of
                     questionnaire question averages.<br/>

                  <br/>
                    In this research we tested the usability of a Hololens applica- tion in training users to work with a machine that they have had no
                    previous experience of working with. We prepared a paper documentation based on official manufacturer guide- lines for using the
                    machine and tested it as a baseline for our main Augmented Reality application. As our findings show, using an AR application in
                    Hololens can increase the learn- ing experience of a user in some aspects while imposing new limitations as well. In this research
                    we used the same type of content in two different formats in order to maintain the con- sistency of the content and only compare the
                    effect of device or medium in learning experience. If we had more time, we could try a different type of content and techniques such
                    as space mapping and object recognition in order to annotate the machine in parts and see if it will help the user more in understanding
                    mechanisms. Though the findings of this re- search project might not be convincing in making decisions for using Hololens application in
                    place of paper or handheld mobile devices, it is a good start for exploring options that can replace the traditional way of teaching or
                    learning to work with new devices that have a certain amount of com- plexity that a single user might not feel comfortable to start
                    working with without any beforehand training.

                  This project was part of a team work for the course "Advanced Visialization Environments" at the Information School
                  at UT Austin. It was supervised by <strong>Dr. Luis Francisco-Revilla</strong> and I had the chance to collaborate with <strong>Christopher Repka</strong>
                  and <strong>Peidi Sun</strong>  and <strong>Xiangrui Deng</strong> as my wonderful teammates.
