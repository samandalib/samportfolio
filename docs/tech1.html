                      We all had this experience of being in a new place and felt that we needed someone to <strong>help us
                      find out where to go or what to do next</strong>. Our initial concept came from our
                      personal experiences. As a student at the University of Texas at Austin,
                      we visit new buildings and new places very often, but it’s also common
                      that we couldn’t find the places we’re looking for or we don’t know how
                     to interact with the facilities in the places.
                     In this project we propose a mobile application prototype that aims at making the process of finding a room in a building
                     easier. We had an iterative approach between design and usability testing to get to the final result.

                      We noticed that there are many signs being placed to inform people.
                      For example, the posters in a large building like a public library are installed to
                      teach patrons how to use the check out machine, and where to find printers, and etc.
                      However, are the posters the best way to deliver this information? How can a user find where printers are located?
                      Can we use technology to create a better experience?
                      These are the questions that we started thinking about at the begining of the project and we hoped to be able
                      to find a solution that can address a majority of issues related to the need for being guided inside a building.

                        Our initial concept was to combine Augmented Reality technology with messaging.
                        By putting smart guidelines in the space as a message, we can help people to get
                        familiar with a new place faster than ever.</br>
                        In order to dive deeper into our concept of AR plus messaging,
                        we conducted a competitive analysis to understand the current usage of AR.

                        From the competitive analysis and our research of AR technologies, we learned that AR can be applied to different areas such as healthcare, entertainment,
                         constructions, etc. Our team reached a consensus to focus on solving the problems on campus and target students as our users. We brainstormed cases that
                          we can apply AR to help students and created a mind map to visualize our user cases.

                        In order to dive deeper into our concept of AR messaging, we conducted a competitive analysis to understand the current applications using AR. We could identify some
                        categories that each of the existing apps or platforms can fall into. Most of the AR apps in the market are used for entertaining purposes and the rest with other purposes
                        couldn't find a good standing point in the market so far.

                        After identifying the problem and brainstorming for the possible solutions and going deeper into the use case of AR technology, it was time to put more
                        focus on users and the experience that we wanted to provide for them. This project had several user research steps that started with conducting a survey for
                        getting insights and evaluation of our target community and their needs and preferences.

                        After deciding about our user community we brainstormed some of the possible problems that students have and we might be able to help them with our App. We designed a survey questionnaire with three sections.</br>
                        In the first section of survey, we asked students to rate the difficulty level of several scenarios.</br>
                        In the second section of the survey, we asked about the students’ preferred types of guiding material.</br>
                        In the last section, asked students about their preferred way of obtaining information.</br>
                        We distributed the link to our questionnaire at several social networks and about 46 responses were gathered. The following charts show the results of this survey.

                      </br>
                        After seeing the survey results, We already decided to focus on the main problem, i.e. finding a room at the campus. So we
                        interviewed four students from UT Austin to learn more about their experience in finding places on campus.
                        During the interview, we asked open-ended questions to elicit interviewees’ stories, thoughts, and actions.
                        The following questions were some that we asked:</br>
                        - Do you remember the first time you visited UT campus? Where did you visit? How did you find the place?</br>
                        - Have you experienced any difficulty in finding a room on campus? If yes, how did you tackle this difficulty? If no, how do you do that?</br>
                        We interviewed 4 students and gathered and made the Affinity Diagram and Journey Map as an starting point for our application
                        design.

                          Based on the insights we got from the affinity diagram, we created a journey map.
                          The map shows that students have many negative experiences when they’re searching to find a room, which aligns with our survey’s results.
                          We identified users’ pain points and our product’s opportunities in the entire journey.

                      The indoor navigation application in the first iteration of the design cycle had two parts. The first part, “Find AR content” was for users to find information about a place.
                      The second part, “Create AR content” was for users to create AR content in the space.
                      Once the user taps the first button, the app will ask what the user is looking for, and then users can type in the room code.

                    One of the biggest differences between indoor and outdoor navigation is that all the objects are closer to the user when they are inside of a building.
                    Hence, our team believes that the best solution for interior navigation is highlighting targets for users instead of showing a path on the ground.
                    The app highlights objects that users need to pass by with instructions in a box.</br>
                    As another feature, when users arrive at the destination, they can end the navigation by tapping the Done button. If users get lost and want to go back to the previous screen,
                     the button on the bottom right allows the user to select and go back to the previous stage.

                The following screens show our ideas for the process of creating AR content. The creation starts from the recording button in the middle of the screen, and the whole
                recording could be ended with the red button on the bottom left. The users can use the toolbox to add text, voice, picture, and shapes to space.

                        <strong>&#9888;</strong>  Users felt confused about the buttons</br>
                        <strong>&#9888;</strong>  Users would like to know the system status</br>
                        <strong>&#9888;</strong>  Users suggested that highlighting the elevators makes more sense than highlighting the whole elevator zone</br>
                        <strong>&#9888;</strong>  Users passed the destination without knowing they’ve arrived</br>
                        <strong>&#9888;</strong>  In one of the testings, a door on the route to the destination was locked. Our app didn’t provide any assistance</br>
                        <strong>&#9888;</strong>  Users felt confused about the icon on the bottom right</br>

                      based on the findings at this stage, we made the following decisions:</br>
                      <strong>&#9755;</strong> Replace the technical jargon with more common words</br>
                      <strong>&#9755;</strong> Separate Creation part and consider it as another application</br>
                      <strong>&#9755;</strong> Make the start of the app more simple and straightforward</br>
                      <strong>&#9755;</strong> Remove unnecessary functions from the app</br>
                      <strong>&#9755;</strong> Considering Reroute function</br>
                      <strong>&#9755;</strong> Making the destination point more clear for the user</br>

                  Based on the feedback and findings we got from the lo-fi testing, we iterated the prototype into medium-fidelity.
                  The first change is that a voice command feature is added to the application. So the user can select if they want to talk to the system or use text input. If user chooses voice assistance,
                  it will then ask users the room number and then confirms the number by repeating it. If the user chooses to use text,
                  they can simply put the room code into the box, and the system can identify the building code and room number.
                </p>

                We moved the text bar from the bottom to the upper, changed the rectangle into gradient color to highlight targets.
                When the user’s phone is not toward a target, a blue arrow notifies the user to change the direction. If the highlighted target is a door,
                the text box reminds the user to try Reroute option from menu. We also added a big icon in front of the destination.

                        <strong>&#9888;</strong>  The form of the Menu button was not clear for users</br>
                        <strong>&#9888;</strong>  A user didn’t realize the icon on the button left is sound control</br>
